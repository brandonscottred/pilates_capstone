Pilates Capstone
## Overview

<!-- Pilates exercise app that allows users to post their own exercise cues and insctructions for how to perform the movement.  -->

### Problem

<!-- Pilates like many other physical fitness regimes requires intricate and detailed instructions for how to perform the movements. In many of these ideals for the exercise there is an overwhelming amont of different ways to describe the instruction and some ways do not work for certain bodies. In many cases those who have a practice over some time keep their own personal diaries or libraries of ways that they have learned the movement that makes sense to them. My goal is to address this gap and make a cusomtizable comments section for 25 different Pilates exercises and add exercise cues that make sense for me and my body so that I can refer to them when needed. -->

## Roadmap

<!-- - create DB of 25 Pilates exercises
- find images/videos to represent exercises
- locate Pilates API to assist with adding more info to each Pilates exercise page
- implement comments form to add your specific instructions or cues that make sense to you
- cleanup site and ensure there is profesional looking landing page and everything is neat, ordered and responsive at mobile, tablet and desktop breakpoints -->

## Nice-to-haves

<!-- - more detailed captions for the pilates exercises than just comments/instructions, maybe one for favorite modification or beginners / advanced version, might also be nice to have a spot for favorite equipment to use with exercise eg. band, loop, chair etc.  -->
